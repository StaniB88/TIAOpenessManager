## What is TIA Openness Manager?

TIA Openness Manager is a powerful tool for Siemens TIA Portal developers that revolutionizes the export, import, and management of PLC program blocks. With an intuitive user interface and advanced features like difference comparison, protection profiles, and AI integration, it significantly increases productivity and reduces errors in project management.

**Key Benefits:**
- Export/import hundreds of blocks with a single click
- Find and remove unused (dead) code from your projects
- Compare block changes with fingerprint-based diff detection
- Protect critical blocks from accidental overwrites
- AI-powered code generation via MCP Server integration
